# Angular-Ramen-Shop

Hello, this is a Website that I made for a School project. This project involved creating an online store with various features such as:
- User authentication
- User levels
- Creating a cart
- Browsing a catalog
- Creating public and private shopping lists
- Allowing a store owner to modify the inventory

This website was created using AngularJS for the front end and NodeJS and Express for the backend as well as MongoDB
